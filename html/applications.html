          From all backgrounds, ethnicities and incomes, UC attracts the best and brightest. UC undergraduates come from all over California, and they work hard to make it to college. In fact, over 40 percent of UC students come from low-income families. UC's faculty
          are the drivers behind innovations in biotechnology, computer science, art and architecture — and they bring that knowledge, that greatness, directly to the classroom. Thousands of California jobs, billions of dollars in revenues, and countless
          everyday household items — from more plentiful fruits and vegetables to compact fluorescent light bulbs — can be traced back to UC discoveries. Similarly, many of the state’s leading businesses are based on UC technology, founded by our faculty
          or led by UC graduates.

          The Common Application (informally known as the Common App) is an undergraduate college admission application that applicants may use to apply to any of 731 member colleges and universities in 48 states and the District of Columbia, as well as in Canada,
          China, and many European countries.[1] Member colleges and universities that accept the Common App are made up of over 100 public universities, nine Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and over 250 institutions that do not require
          an application fee. It is managed by the staff of a not-for-profit membership association (The Common Application, Inc.) and governed by a 13-member volunteer Board of Directors drawn from the ranks of college admission deans and secondary school
          college guidance counselors. Its mission is to promote access, equity, and integrity in the college admission process, which includes subjective factors gleaned from essays and recommendations alongside more objective criteria such as class
          rank and standardized testing.</td>

            The UC application does not have essays, they have personal insight questions. The personal insight questions are about getting to know you better — your life experience, interests, ambitions and inspirations. For each question you can respond with a maximum
            of 350 words. Think of it as your interview with the admissions office. Be open. Be reflective. Find your individual voice and express it. While this section of the application is just one part UC considers when making its admission decision, it helps provide
            context for the rest of your application. When submitting your application you only include 4 of the 8 prompts they offer, chose and answer the for that apply most to you.
          </p>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>
            2.) Every person has a creative side, and it can be expressed in many ways: problem solving, original and innovative thinking, and artistically, to name a few. Describe how you express your creative side.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.) What would you say is your greatest talent or skill? How have you developed and demonstrated that talent over time?

            4.) Describe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced.
          </p>
          <p>
            5.) Describe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement?
          </p>
          <p>
            6.) Think about an academic subject that inspires you. Describe how you have furthered this interest inside and/or outside of the classroom.
          </p>
          <p>
            7.) What have you done to make your school or your community a better place?
